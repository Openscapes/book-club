# Openscapes book club
We're trying out a book club for anyone to suggest and discuss books relevant to the Openscapes community! We'll use GitHub issues for suggestions, asynchronous comments, scheduling discussions, and sharing notes.

## Recommend a book
Want to recommend a book to others? Want to have a 1-hr synchronous discussion about a book? 

We've created a GitHub Issue Template to help you share key information. In the Issues tab, click 'New Issue' then click the green [`Get started`](https://github.com/Openscapes/book-club/issues/new/choose) button on the 'Suggest a book' template. The template guides you in what to add.

## Issue labels 
  
`0/suggestion`  
`1/scheduled` - a synchronous discussion (via Zoom or similar) has been scheduled, or   
`2/completed` - discussion of a great book is never really completed but this means we've had a discussion, and we should probably add a link to notes in that book's issue.
